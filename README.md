## About the project :mag:
This project was my first go at JavaScript basics, I have referred to certain YouTube videos and online tutorials for the development of this project. The Google Tic Tac Toe was an inspiration for the game's design and development. 

This was a super fun project and I got to learn pretty cool stuff during the development period. Hope you enjoy and please feel free to drop your thoughts on the project.:placard:

Enjoy the game:bangbang:
